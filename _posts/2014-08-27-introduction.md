I'm a Computer Science student at Open University. My degree is called *Computing & IT (Design with Software Development)*.

In school, I'm studying general software production with Java, along with some Design courses. Outside of school, I'm studying Python, Web Design (CSS/SASS, HTML and JavaScript), a little bit of C# and more. Programming has fully taken the place of video games in my life; I can honestly say I get more of a rush out of solving a Project Euler problem efficiently than I get out of Head Shots in Call of Duty.

I'm using this blog to experiment with web design and also occasionally post about programming and design, or whatever else I want to write about.
