## Introduction

I've been intrigued by what I've read of Flexbox in css since I first heard of it, but I'd never read any clear writup about how to use it effectively and I didn't really have the time to experiment. I finally came up with a usecase for it, though -- an excuse to get my hands dirty and try it out -- and in the context of this blog no less! This post is a walkthrough of my experiments with using `display: flex` and the css properties that go with it.
